7-day roguelike Challenge, 2016

## Introduction

This is my entry for 7DRL 2016. 

Magescape is a 1HP tactical roguelike centered around the mechanic of laying traps, and teleporting enemies into them. The freeze + switch places mechanic was borrowed from Valkyrie Profile on PlayStation 1.

To follow the progress, take a look at [the log](LOG.md). I'll try to update it on each commit.

## Prior Code/Work

I ripped out 60 lines of utility code from my [almostvanilla.js](https://github.com/cvasseng/almostvanilla.js) library dealing with type checks and deep object merging. Nothing game related, in other words. Everything else is written from scratch for and during the challenge, based on a [page with bullet points](progressgifs/code_design_doc.jpg) I wrote down a couple of days before the challenge started.

The tileset was taken from a [tigsource](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=14166.0) thread - see below for credits.
